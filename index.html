                <p style="color: var(--whiteish);">Helion is a FIRST Robotics team located at Dulwich College Beijing that was founded in 2018, with the purpose to successfully build and program a competition robot that will attend and compete in one of the FIRST Robotics regionals, located either in Shanghai or Shenzhen. Through growth and development, we hope to improve not only as individuals, but as a whole team. Our belief is that this experience will teach young students at Dulwich the perseverance and dedication needed to follow through on a path of their choice, carrying the spirit of the Helion team on into their future lives.</p>
