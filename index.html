                <p style="color: var(--whiteish);">We're a FIRST Robotics team that was founded in 2018 and is located at Dulwich College Beijing. We hope to successfully build and program a competition robot to attend and compete in one of the FIRST Robotics regionals, at either Shanghai or Shenzhen. Through growth and development, we hope to improve as not only individuals, but as a team. We believe that this will be an experience that will teach young people the perseverance needed to follow through on a path of their choosing, carrying this spirt onto the road to adulthood.</p>
